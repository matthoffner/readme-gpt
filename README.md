The `main.py` script is a Python script that uses langchain to perform language model training and evaluation on text data. It provides a command-line interface for running various tasks on the text data, including preprocessing, training, and evaluating a language model.

To use this script, you will need to have langchain installed. You can install it by following the instructions provided in the `README.md` file for your specific platform. Once you have installed langchain, you can run the main script, `main.py`, from the command line using the following command:

```
python main.py --repo repo/path --model model/path > README.md :)
```
